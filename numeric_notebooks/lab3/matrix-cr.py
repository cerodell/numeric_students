# Boundary condtions for a Dirichlet problem are:
# $$
# u(0)=u(1)=0

# *Solution of an ODE Using Linear Algebra*
# - a\) Using Python, compute the condition number for the matrix 
# ùê¥1 from Equation Differential System Matrix for several values of
#  ùëÅ between 5 and 50. ( Hint: This will be much easier if you write 
# a small Python function that outputs the matrix ùê¥ for a given value
#  of ùëÅ.)

# large as the matrix become larger and more difficult to solve**
