# ## Problem One
# Using the scheme presented in this section, modify advection3.py 
# to solve the following advection problem: The wind is moving along
# the x-axis with speed ùë¢=20 m/s. The initial distribution curve is 
# 290 km in width. Use your program to approximate the curve during 24 hours.
#
# $$
# \\
# $$
# - a\) Run your program for different orders of approximating polynomials (up to 4).
#  Compare the accuracy of approximation for different orders. Do you see better 
#  results with increasing order? Is this true for all orders from 0 to 4?
#   Is there any particularity to odd and even order polynomials?
